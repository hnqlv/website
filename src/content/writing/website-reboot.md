title: Website reboot
summary: I've missed having a space to dump my thoughts without overthinking.

It's been a while since I've written code just for myself, and I've missed having a space to dump my thoughts.

I started with Next.js, then tried Ruby, but both felt like overkill for what I needed. I wanted something simple, static-first, and Markdown friendly.

Hello [Astro](https://astro.build/) üëãüèº! It promises to be "content-driven for sites and blogs," and it didn't disappoint. Super easy and intuitive, it reminded me of the good old Gatsby days, but with just the good parts. Plus, it supports Markdown out of the box.

For inspiration, I looked to some of my favorite personal websites: [@nelson.co](https://nelson.co), [@kepano](https://x.com/kepano), [@henricreates](https://x.com/henricreates), and [@pepicrft](https://x.com/pepicrft).


The site stack is simple: Astro, and [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for web hosting. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hnqlv/website).

I hope this space will soon be filled with ideas, thoughts, nonsense, experiments, and maybe even be helpful to someone out there.
